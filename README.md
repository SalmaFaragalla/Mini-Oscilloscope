# PWM-Drawer

## Description
This project was implemented as a part of NeuronetiX  Embedded systems Internship.
PWM drawer works as a mini oscilloscope that is responsible 
for printing the frequency and the waveform of the generated PWM signal.
The generated wave came from two sources, external sources 
, or internal source of the Microcontroller of the project itself.

## Specifications 
With the graphical LCD we can display the following:
- The shape of the generated PWM from internally or externally sources.
- The frequency in KHz of the generated wave .
- The duty cycle of the generated wave .
- The period of the single cycle

## Components: 
- STM32F103C6 Microcontroller
- Graphical LCD
- Signal Generator (optional)
